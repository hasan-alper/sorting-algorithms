# sorting-algorithms

A sorting algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and either ascending or descending.

## Various sorting algorithms

### Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

**Time complexity analysis:**

|Worst Case|Average Case|Best Case|
|---|---|---|
|O(n<sup>2</sup>)|O(n<sup>2</sup>)|O(n)|
